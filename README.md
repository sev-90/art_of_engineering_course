# Introduction

Welcome to the Smart Cities project repository for the Art of Engineering course! In this course, we'll be exploring the exciting field of smart cities, which combines technology, data analysis, and urban planning to create more efficient and livable cities.

As part of this course, you'll be working on a small project that will give you hands-on experience with some of the tools and techniques used in smart cities. Specifically, you'll be using point of interest data to create maps and visualizations that can help us better understand urban environments.

To help you get started, we've provided some code snippets and data sets in this repository. These resources will give you a foundation to work from as you begin to explore the data and develop your own insights.

Throughout the project, you'll have the opportunity to collaborate with your classmates, share your findings, and receive feedback from your peers and instructors. We encourage you to take advantage of these opportunities to learn from each other and develop your skills as a data analyst and urban planner.

We hope that you find this project to be both challenging and rewarding, and we look forward to seeing the insights that you'll uncover as you work on it. Good luck, and have fun!

## Requirements
1) Python installation: I want you to have python installed in your computer.
2) A text editor or IDE: You need a text editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to open and edit the python files. My suggestion for Python development environment is Visual Studio Code.
3) Very basic programming knowledge: As with working in Jupyter Notebook, you will need a basic understanding of programming concepts such as variables, data types, control structures, and functions.
